# Data-Analysis-Using-Excel
This is a Volunteer project (Pet Project). It is an on going project that I am doing to apply my skills and knowledge about Data Analysis using Excel. I keep on adding to it as I learn. I chose the 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results data (i.e. Athens 1896 to Rio 2016) as my data set and built an analysis using Microsoft Excel
